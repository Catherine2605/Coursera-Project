# Coursera-Project
Final project for Week 6 in Coursera course Data Analysis with R
For some reason, whenever I would save my Rdata and then open the file again after, it always comes up blank. I tried creating it and saving it and then creating it and saving it again but my work doesn't save. Whenever I would open the preivously saved files, they're all blank. I don't know what to do so I just copied the script in R and pasted it into the Notepad application. Then I saved it as a .txt file. This is what I will be submitting. I hope it's okay. I've been trying all night to remedy the issue but to no avail.
